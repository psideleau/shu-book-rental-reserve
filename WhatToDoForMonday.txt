account deactivation listener class
filter out accounts that have been deactivated

if book is owned by deactivated student, can't order
if student is deactivated, can't order it

ours is availability in our database
we check what is available...filter out unavailable texts

when we rent the book, send ID and ISBN


Goal for Monday:
